       " 'The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes.\\n',\n",
       " 'Domestic cats are similar in size to the other members of the genus Felis, typically weighing between 4 and 5 kg (8.8 and 11.0 lb).\\n',\n",
       " 'However, if the output is piped or redirected, cat is unnecessary.\\n',\n",
       " 'cat with one named file is safer where human error is a concern - one wrong use of the default redirection symbol \">\" instead of \"<\" (often adjacent on keyboards) may permanently delete the file you were just needing to read.\\n',\n",

       " 'Using cat command, the lines received from stdin can be redirected to a new file using redirection symbols.\\n',\n",
